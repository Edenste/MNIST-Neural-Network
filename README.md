# MNIST Neural Network
- - -
A neural network trained on the MNIST dataset in order to recognise handwritten digits as numbers. Developed in python using NumPy and TensorFlow. By default it set to train on 3 epochs and has an accuracy of 97.32%.

# Quick Start
- - -
1. Create a python virtual environment and install packages found in requirements.txt
2. Create and train model by running _create_model.py_
3. Put pngs of digits into _digits_ folder (must be 28x28 resolution)
4. Run _read_digits.py_ for results
